## Languages
The coding languages used
- HTML

## Software
The design for RISE Media was created via the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite; more specifically I used:
- Abobe Photoshop
- Adobe InDesign
- Adobe Illustrator

Through using these three tools, I was able to design the logo, create imagery, design the website, and compress web images by either reducing image size or quality via export.
